# Island Power

**Omarchy's Power panel, in the Island look.**
Battery, charge limit, power profiles and system stats, drawn with thin stroke icons and a dark anatomy panel that opens right under its icon.

## Why this one

- ✏️ **The Island look.** Same stroke icons as [Island Bar](https://github.com/hugorolimf/omarchy-bar),
  colour only when it means something, one easing curve for every transition.
- 🧭 **Opens under its icon**, with the keyboard: Esc closes, Tab moves to the next panel.
- 🌍 **English or Portuguese**, following your system language.
- 🔄 **Drop-in.** It's Omarchy's own `omarchy.power` underneath (same behaviour, same
  shortcuts and IPC): enabling it takes the original's place on the bar.

## Requirements

[Island Kit](https://github.com/hugorolimf/omarchy-island-kit): the panel is drawn with it.
Install the Kit first, or install this panel from the Kit's catalog.

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/hugorolimf/omarchy-island-kit --enable
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/hugorolimf/omarchy-island-power --enable
```

## Remove

```bash
omarchy plugin remove io.github.hugorolimf.power
```

Omarchy's own power panel comes back to the bar.

## Credits

A clone of Omarchy's `omarchy.power` panel by David Heinemeier Hansson and the
[Omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy) contributors (MIT); the look, icons and the
Portuguese wording are this plugin's.
