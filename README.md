# Island Power

**Omarchy's Power panel, in the Island look.**
Battery, charge limit, power profiles and system stats, drawn with thin stroke icons and a dark anatomy panel that opens right under its icon.

## Why this one

- ✏️ **The Island look.** Same stroke icons as [Island Bar](https://github.com/hugorolimf/omarchy-bar),
  colour only when it means something, one easing curve for every transition.
- 🧭 **Opens under its icon**, with the keyboard: Esc closes, Tab moves to the next panel.
- 🌍 **English or Portuguese**, following your system language.
- 🔄 **Drop-in.** It's Omarchy's own `omarchy.power` underneath (same behaviour, same
  shortcuts and IPC): enabling it takes the original's place on the bar.

## See it

Recorded on a real desktop, mouse and clicks included. The panel follows the
system language; this take is in Portuguese.

**Power modes and Stay awake**: pick a mode and the panel says what it does; Stay awake glows amber while the screen won't lock.

## Requirements

[Island Kit](https://github.com/hugorolimf/omarchy-island-kit): the panel is drawn with it.
Install the Kit first, or install this panel from the Kit's catalog.
Without the Kit, the plugin shows an "Install Island Kit" button on the bar
(in Portuguese, "Instale o Island Kit"); clicking it installs the Kit and
restarts the shell.

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/hugorolimf/omarchy-island-kit --enable
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/hugorolimf/omarchy-island-power --enable
```

## Remove

```bash
omarchy plugin remove io.github.hugorolimf.power
```

Omarchy's own power panel comes back to the bar.

## Credits

Portuguese wording are this plugin's.
